This repository contains the necessary files to spin up the core microservices for an archival digital repository.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/uchicago-library/microservice_repository_orchestration.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/uchicago-library/microservice_repository_orchestration)

These microservices are still in varying stages of development, changes may occur without warning.

It relies on the following projects:

- [archstor](https://github.com/uchicago-library/archstor) for data storage
- [idnest](https://github.com/uchicago-library/idnest) for basic accession organization
- [qremis_api](https://github.com/uchicago-library/qremis_api) for managing metadata records
- [demo_records_api](https://github.com/uchicago-library/demo_records_api) a quick simple accession/collection records management API
- [microservice_repository_dead_simple_interface](https://github.com/uchicago-library/microservice_repository_dead_simple_interface) An HTTP interface to wrap the API functionalities.

The [accutil](https://github.com/uchicago-library/qremis_accutil) is built to ingest files into the microservice systems.

# Swarm Setup Instructions
## Prerequisites/Notes
- This assumes you have your swarm configured, and are ssh'd into a manager node to run commands from. A basic tutorial utilizing docker-machine can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/create-swarm/)
- Configuration relies on the envsubst command, part of the gettext package. It must be installed on your manager node (or where ever you're building from) To do this in boot2docker: tce-load -wi gettext.tcz
- Setup also requires docker-compose, installation instructions for various platforms [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
    - If using a docker-machine swarm the sudo -i edge case is required.

0. Optional: Configure Swarm Visualizer
If you'd like to have the swarm visualizer
for pretty graphics running at $SWARM_HOST:8080
```
$ docker run -it -d -p 8080:8080 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock dockersamples/visualizer
```

1. Configure the Registry
Manually fire up a docker image registry. If you already have a registry,
instead set the $REGISTRY environmental variable.
```
$ docker service create --name registry --publish 5000:5000 registry:2
```

2. Clone the Git Repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/uchicago-library/microservice_repository_orchestration.git
```

3. Navigate into the Repository Root
```
$ cd microservice_repository_orchestration
```

4. Clone the Other Relevant Git Repositories
```
$ ./clone_repos.sh
```

5. Edit Settings in the vars.env File
     - **!! NOTE: This file is going to get sourced in later scripts. !!**

Use whatever editor you like, the file is plaintext. Nano example provided:
```
$ nano vars.env
```

6. Build the YML for Docker Compose
```
$ ./build_swarm_yml.sh
```

7. Build the Container Images
```
$ docker-compose -f swarm_stack.yml build
```

8. Push the Built Images to the Docker Repository
```
$ docker-compose -f swarm_stack.yml push
```

9. Deploy the Services to the Swarm
```
$ docker stack deploy --compose-file swarm_stack.yml repository_swarm
```
You should now be able to navigate to $SWARM_HOST and see the interface

# Compose Setup Instructions
## Prerequisites/Notes
- If your sh doesn't support source you may have to run the sh scripts with bash manually
- Configuration relies on the envsubst command, part of the gettext package. It must be installed on your manager node (or where-ever you're building from) To do this in boot2docker: tce-load -wi gettext.tcz
- Setup also requires docker-compose, installation instructions for various platforms [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

1. Clone the Git Repository

$ git clone https://github.com/uchicago-library/microservice_repository_orchestration.git
```

```
$ cd microservice_repository_orchestration
```

5. Build the YML for Docker Compose
```
$ ./build_compose_yml.sh
```

6. Build the Container Images
```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build
```

8. Start the containers
```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```
You should now be able to navigate to $UNIFIER_HOST:$UNIFIER_EXTERNAL_PORT
